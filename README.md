An AI-powered service that automatically generates documentation and validated, executable examples for Python code snippets.

## Core Features

*   **Automated Docstrings**: Analyzes Python functions to generate comprehensive, well-formatted docstrings.
*   **Example Generation**: Creates simple, illustrative code examples to demonstrate usage.
*   **Self-Correction & Validation**: A key feature—the agent executes its own generated examples in a sandboxed environment. If the code fails, it analyzes the error, corrects the code, and re-tests until it succeeds.
*   **API-Driven**: Built with FastAPI, providing a clean, modern REST API for easy integration.
*   **Transparent Reasoning**: The API can return the agent's full chain of thought, offering complete visibility into its analysis and decision-making process.

## How It Works

This project uses a **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** agent built with the LangChain framework. The agent follows a strict, iterative process to ensure the quality of its output:

1.  **Analyze**: The agent first uses an `CodeAnalyzer` tool to understand the purpose, parameters, dependencies, and return values of the input code.
2.  **Draft**: Based on its analysis, it drafts a docstring and a simple example.
3.  **Validate**: **This is the critical step.** The agent executes the complete drafted example (including the function definition) in a `CodeExecutionEnvironment`.
4.  **Refine or Finalize**:
    *   If the execution fails, the agent reads the error message, refines its code, and returns to the validation step.
    *   If the execution succeeds, the agent confidently packages the documentation and the now-proven example into a final answer.

This validation loop ensures that the generated code isn't just plausible—it's guaranteed to be runnable.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend**: FastAPI
*   **AI Framework**: LangChain
*   **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o
*   **Server**: Uvicorn
*   **Testing**: Pytest

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   An OpenAI API Key

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:SniksaX/AgenticAI.git
    cd AgenticAI
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file from the project's imports. It should include `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `langchain`, `langchain-openai`, `python-dotenv`, and `func-timeout`.)*

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ```

### 3. Running the Application

Launch the development server using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the interactive Swagger UI documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### 4. Running Tests

To ensure all components are working correctly, run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

## 💡 API Usage

You can send a POST request to the `/process-code` endpoint to have the agent document your code.

#### Example Request with `curl`

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/process-code' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "code_snippet": "def calculate_average(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)"
}'
```

#### Example Successful Response

The API will return a JSON object containing the status, the generated documentation (which includes the validated example), and the agent's thought process.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "documentation": "```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.\n\n    Parameters:\n    numbers (list of int or float): A list of numbers to average.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The average of the numbers, or 0 if the list is empty.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> calculate_average([10, 20, 30])\n    20.0\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0\n    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n# Example usage\nresult = calculate_average([15, 25, 35, 45])\nprint(f\"The average is: {result}\")\n```",
  "example_code": "See documentation for example (Agent combines them)",
  "agent_trace": "Thought: I need to analyze the code...\nAction: CodeAnalyzer...\nObservation: ...\nThought: I will draft documentation and an example...\nAction: CodeExecutionEnvironment...\nObservation: EXECUTION_SUCCESS: The average is: 30.0\nThought: The example code has been successfully validated. I am now ready to provide the final answer.\nFinal Answer: ..."
}
```
