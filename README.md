## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project implements an intelligent AI Agent that generates high-quality, executable documentation for Python code snippets. Powered by **FastAPI** and **LangChain's ReAct Agent framework**, it not only drafts explanations but critically **validates generated example code** through a sandboxed execution environment, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

The agent is designed to understand code, create docstrings, and most importantly, self-correct example code based on live execution feedback until it runs successfully.

## âœ¨ Key Features

*   **Intelligent Code Analysis**: Leverages an LLM-powered tool to deeply analyze Python code structure, purpose, and dependencies.
*   **ReAct Agent Architecture**: Employs LangChain's ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework, enabling the agent to `Thought`, `Action`, `Observation` in an iterative loop for robust problem-solving.
*   **Self-Correction with Code Execution**: Integrates a sandboxed Python execution environment to test and validate generated example code. The agent actively corrects its examples based on runtime errors or successes.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation**: Produces rich documentation including docstrings, parameter descriptions, return types, and usage examples.
*   **FastAPI Backend**: Provides a robust and scalable API endpoint for easy integration and consumption.
*   **Detailed Logging**: Captures the agent's full "chain of thought" for transparency and debugging.

## ðŸš€ How it Works

The system operates as a sophisticated pipeline, where a FastAPI endpoint receives code, and an intelligent agent processes it through an iterative, self-correcting loop.
